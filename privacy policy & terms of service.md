<h1 align="center">Privacy Policy</h1>

If FurBot has a database enabled it will store data based on the user giving and receiving command actions like hug or shoot. This data is stored with numbers and is attached to the users Discord ID in the database. You can find the code for this [here](https://github.com/Gideon-Foxo/FurBot-foxo-edition/blob/main/src/scripts/snippets.js#L132) and [here](https://github.com/Gideon-Foxo/FurBot-foxo-edition/blob/main/src/commands/information/stats.js).

This data is stored securely and is never exposed to the public. We will take effort to remain transparent and notify you as soon as possible if we believe any breach of data has occurred. Data is only stored for the sole purpose of providing functionality within Discord.

Under no circumstances is any user data shared with third parties.

You can delete your data at any time with the `/deletedata` command. If no database is enabled or if you have no data an error message will be returned instead.

If FurBot does not have a database enabled the only data FurBot stores is temporarily caching users.
